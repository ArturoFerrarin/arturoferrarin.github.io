Aaaaand... We're live!

# Well. I did it

After hours of nerding, I finally managed to get this site working. Dunno completely why, but I did.
Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Huxpro">Hux</a> for his incredibly well-made base. Without him I'd probably still trying to mess with html syntax.
Anyway, this is just an unofficial draft of a possibile new Arturo Ferrarin's Github.io.

## What to put in here?

Well, actually you can do (almost) whatever you can do with a normal site, plus some exceptional Github features. Like using jekyll, as I am doing right now.

## What about students?

What could Github Pages means to the students? Well, first of all a new way to approach to the web and the internet itself. They could learn how to push commits, and once done, they could join the organization itself and make this site finally useful.

## School projects

The projects you may add are a lot. From simple newspaper articles to entire applications, books, websites, 3D projects, geometric plants, aerial charts, but also photos, videos, music... So yeah, a bit of everything.
### How to navigate?

Pretty easy. Click where you want to do, done.
